-->> Customer Conversion Prediction  <<--

This is a Machine Learning model developed using XGBoost Classifier that predicts whether a customer will convert or not for an insurance company. 

-->> Data <<--

The dataset used for this project contains information about the customers, such as their age, gender, salary, etc. 
It also contains information about their interactions with the company, such as the number of calls they made to customer service, the type of policy they are interested 
in, etc. The dataset contains both categorical and numerical variables.

The XGBoost Classifier was chosen for this project due to its ability to handle both categorical and numerical variables, as well as its high accuracy and efficiency. 
The model was trained on a portion of the dataset using cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters, and then tested on a holdout set to evaluate its performance.

The final model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an AUC score of 0.92, indicating that it is a reliable predictor of customer conversion.
